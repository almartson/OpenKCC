The mole digging animation is a little bit terrible. 

I ended up offsetting the model root's local y down by 0.32f.

and the animation itself crunches the model arround in a weird way to get the nose where I wanted it. 

Also with the dig particles. I had to shift the local y transform to be 0.125.

One last thing, you might need to re-assign the materials, But I'm not certain on that.

Thanks,

Tom.
